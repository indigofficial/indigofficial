# Hello!

I'm Indigo, the programmer and artist behind [Quokka Qommunity](https://github.com/cookibytes). A quokka is a cute, endangered animal that lives on an island off the coast of Western Australia. They are endangered because of foxes destroying their habitats, and are also easy prey for bigger predators. Not only that, but in 2015, there was a bushfire that devastated a significant population of mainland quokkas. Quokka Qommunity is an NFT project with a goal to help the quokkas by raising awareness to this endangered species, and also donating to save the quokkas!
